<h2>Lands</h2>
<h3>Ilaris</h3>
<p>The homeland of all inhabitants of the great World. Mostly settled, Ilaris still boasts
beautiful landscapes and rich resources. Seperated into [insert amount here] territories Ilaris was the only
known landmass. Riddled with territory wars and scuffles only certain areas are safe for civilians.
etc...</p>
<br/>
<h4>Thorien</h4>
<p>The Great Kingdom, Thorien, was one of great prosperity. That is, until the hideous
Generals rose up and took power over the monsters. In the beginning monster attacks
were very poorly organized and rather sporadic. Recently they have become more organized.
Theories suggest that a group of generals must have seized power over the heinous creatures.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Nularis</h3>
<p>A beautiful new land discovered due to the recent lull in the normally rugged riptides
and maelstroms to the east. It is vast and plentiful in both beautiful scenes and resources.
Beautiful as it may be it is an untamed land by day, and dreadful nightmare filled with
awful creatures at night. Therefore it has only been opened up to adventures to settle.</p>
<br>
<h4>New Royal</h4>
<p>The first established outpost in Nularis. A nice port town located on a tropical,
    beautifully shaped crescent island just off the coast of the mainland. This is an adventurers first stop before heading inland.
An adventurer must first register to get seed money to stake their first plot.</p>
